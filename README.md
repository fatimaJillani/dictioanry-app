# React Dictionary App

## Overview
The React Dictionary App is a web application designed to look up words and explore their meanings, phonetic spellings, and audio pronunciations. It provides a user-friendly interface for discovering and understanding the nuances of language.

## Features Implemented
1. **Word Lookup:** Search for words to retrieve their meanings.
2. **Phonetic Spelling:** Access the phonetic representation of each word.
3. **Audio Pronunciations:** Listen to the correct pronunciation of words.

## Technologies Used
- React
- [Merriam-Webster API](https://dictionaryapi.com/) for word data


## Setup / Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dictionary-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd react-dictionary-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Get API Key:**
   - Obtain an API key from [Merriam-Webster API](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Usage
1. **Search for Words:**
   - Enter a word in the search bar to retrieve its meaning.

2. **Phonetic Spelling:**
   - View the phonetic representation of the searched word.

3. **Audio Pronunciations:**
   - Click the audio icon to listen to the correct pronunciation of the word.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
